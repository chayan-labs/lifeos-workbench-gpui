# AI memory - the cognitive memory architecture

Memory for an AI that manages a whole life is not "a vector database you dump things into."
It is a **cognitive-architecture** problem: years of heterogeneous, cross-domain, temporal data, retrieved under a fixed context window, with auditable provenance and tenant isolation.
This doc specifies Life OS's memory as a **layered, event-sourced cognitive memory** built on the substrate the system already has (`events`, `entities`, `edges`, derived FTS5 + sqlite-vec), plus the three pieces that turn that substrate into a brain: consolidation, activation-scored retrieval, and a context compiler.

> Design grounding: this synthesizes the field's best ideas - Stanford Generative Agents (reflection + recency/importance/relevance scoring), Zep/Graphiti (bi-temporal knowledge graph), Letta sleep-time compute, ENGRAM (typed partitioning), ActiveGraph/ESAA/SSGM (event-sourcing for agent memory), and ACT-R (activation decay) - onto Life OS's existing append-only spine.
> The novel angles versus the standard "LLM-writes-structured-notes" or "flat top-k RAG" approach are called out as **Novel:** inline.

> Invariant alignment: nothing here relaxes [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) or [DATA-MODEL.md](./DATA-MODEL.md).
> `events` stays append-only; the derived store stays un-synced; secrets never enter memory; agent memory-writes are themselves events (reversible via the [AGENT-CONTROL.md](./AGENT-CONTROL.md) ledger).

## 1. Four memory layers, mapped to primitives Life OS already has

The reference model is the cognitive-science taxonomy (Soar/ACT-R), not RAG:

| Layer | "What it is" | Life OS primitive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Working memory** | the live context window + a small scratchpad | the per-turn compiled context (§6) |
| **Episodic** | timestamped "what happened" | the append-only `events` log (the source of truth) |
| **Semantic** | distilled "what is true" - facts, profiles, entity summaries | `entities` + `edges` (a temporal knowledge graph) + derived `memory_nodes`/`memory_summaries` |
| **Procedural** | "how to behave" - learned rules/preferences | a procedural-memory store feeding the system prompt (§8); ties to the harness Release loop |

A whole-life system needs all four plus a maintenance loop between them.
A flat vector store is a weak version of one.

## 2. Core invariant - memory is a derived, rebuildable projection of the event log

**Novel:** Most memory systems make the memory store *primary* and mutate it in place (Mem0's ADD/UPDATE/DELETE, A-MEM's note evolution, LangMem's manager).
That is exactly what produces contradictory, un-auditable, hallucinated memory and painful multi-tier sync.

Life OS inverts this.
The append-only `events` log is the **single source of truth**; *all* semantic memory - summaries, embeddings, profiles, the FTS5/vector indices, the whole graph projection - is a **read model that can be deleted and recomputed from events** (event-sourcing / CQRS applied to memory).

This gives, for free:
- **Provenance:** every fact carries `source_event_ids`; nothing is a memory without a traceable origin (no fabricated memory).
- **Non-destructive forgetting:** you never delete a fact; you supersede it (§7) and let it decay in ranking.
- **Conflict reconciliation by replay:** the documented sync model (last-push-wins; `events` as reconciliation truth) extends directly to memory.
- **Counterfactual forking:** branch the log at any event and recompute ("what would my month look like if I hadn't taken that trade?").

This pattern is barely in the published literature (ActiveGraph, ESAA, SSGM, all early 2026) - Life OS is ahead of the field here precisely because the append-only invariant was already committed to.

**Pitfalls this section must engineer around (validated by the SOTA):**
- **LLM non-determinism breaks naive replay.** Replay needs a **content-addressed response cache**: hash each model request (BLAKE3) and serve the cached response on recompute. Without it, "deterministic replay" is fiction.
- **Storage grows with run length.** Cold events compact to summaries + pointers and tier out to the [storage backends](./STORAGE-BACKENDS.md); raw events are never deleted, only relocated.
- **Schema evolution.** Event types carry a `schema_version` from day 1; replay applies versioned upcasters.
- **Single writer per row** (already the system's discipline) - the event-sourcing papers don't solve concurrent writers, and a personal OS does not need them to.

## 3. The memory read models (rebuildable projections)

Layer 0 (source of truth, synced `lifeos.db`):
```
events(id, type, schema_version, payload_json,
       caused_by_event_id,        -- Novel: causal pointer ("what led to this?")
       entity_id, actor, ts)      -- APPEND-ONLY (no UPDATE/DELETE)
```

Layer 1 (derived projections, rebuildable; metadata in `lifeos.db`, indices in `lifeos-derived.db`):
```
memory_nodes(id, content, importance, access_count, last_accessed,
             confidence, source_event_ids_json, embedding_ref)
memory_edges(from_id, to_id, rel_type,
             t_valid, t_invalid,          -- Novel here: bi-temporal validity (Zep/Graphiti)
             superseded_by_event_id, source_event_id)
memory_summaries(id, level, content, confidence,
                 source_event_ids_json, ts)   -- multi-resolution (episode/day/week/profile)
```

Layer 2 (search indices, un-synced `lifeos-derived.db`, reuse `memvec.py`):
```
entities_fts  USING fts5(...)          -- BM25 (attrs flattened to attrs_text by trigger)
entity_vec    USING vec0(...)          -- MiniLM-384 (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) semantic ANN
```

The derived DB stays a physically separate, never-synced file (libSQL has no table-level sync flag) - and now it is also *safe to blow away*, because §2 makes it recomputable from `events`.

---

## 4. Retrieval - activation-scored, not flat top-k

**Novel:** retrieval is an **activation score** over a hybrid candidate set, not a single vector top-k.

```
A(m) = relevance(m,q) · recency(m) · importance(m) · frequency(m)
relevance = RRF( vector_rank , bm25_rank , entity_match_rank )   -- hybrid, not vector-only
recency   = exp(-λ · Δt)                                         -- ACT-R decay (λ ≈ 0.995/hr)
frequency = log(1 + access_count)                                -- ACT-R base-level activation
importance= salience scored once at write time (cheap)           -- not per-read
```

Pipeline per query:
1. **Query reformulation** (one cheap LLM call): rewrite the turn into "what would a relevant memory look like?" before scoring.
2. **Self-RAG gate:** skip long-term retrieval entirely on turns that don't need it (latency + noise win).
3. Gather candidates from FTS5 (BM25) + sqlite-vec (ANN) + entity match.
4. Score with `A(m)`; take the top set.
5. **Spreading activation (tiered, optional):** for multi-hop queries, expand 1-2 hops over `memory_edges` where `t_invalid IS NULL`, then re-score.
   Graph expansion is *not* always-on - "Does Memory Need Graphs?" (2026) shows it only pays off for multi-hop at scale, so single-hop queries stay on the cheap FTS5+vector path.
6. **Abstention signal:** if the top activation is below threshold, emit "no reliable memory" so the model says *I don't know* instead of confabulating (the LongMemEval failure mode).

This is the SOTA-validated formula (Generative Agents + ACT-R + ENGRAM's typed hybrid), with frequency and BM25 added (both were missing from the naive recency·importance·relevance baseline).

---

## 5. Consolidation - "sleep" jobs that write events, never mutate state

**Novel:** consolidation (Letta calls it sleep-time compute; Generative Agents call it reflection) runs as scheduled background jobs that **emit new provenance-linked events**, rather than overwriting memory.

Jobs (Tokio async on the Mac; triggered on idle + an accumulated-importance threshold):
- `segment_episodes`: cut the raw event stream at **cognitive episode boundaries** (topic shift / task done), not per message - episode-aligned units retrieve better (ES-Mem).
- `consolidate`: episodes -> episode summaries; summaries -> semantic facts; weekly -> reflections (multi-resolution).
- `score_importance` + `score_surprise`: salience at write time; **Novel:** flag low-similarity outliers (surprising/contradicting memories) as high-importance, slow-decay, and trigger reconciliation.
- `decay_sweep`: nightly ranking recompute (no LLM).
- `supersede_detector`: turn UPDATE-type events into `t_invalid` on the old edge + a supersede pointer.

**The unsolved field problem is summarization drift** (rare-but-important details silently dropped) and **reflection self-reinforcement** (a consolidation error propagating with no ground truth).
Life OS's mitigation is structural and not implemented by any current system: **raw events are never deleted, every summary carries `source_event_ids` + a `confidence`/source-count**, so a bad consolidation is auditable and correctable by recompute.
This is a genuine design advantage, again falling out of the append-only spine.

## 6. The context compiler - hybrid-deterministic working memory

**Novel:** working memory is assembled by a **deterministic context compiler** with a token budget, not by LLM-driven paging (MemGPT), which adds hot-path latency and cost.

Per turn, deterministic where it should be, scored where it must be:
- **Deterministic:** budget allocation (N tokens recent-turns-verbatim, M tokens retrieved facts, P tokens procedural rules), the recency window (always include the last K turns), and template formatting/injection.
- **Scored:** *what* fills the retrieval budget (the `A(m)` ranking from §4).
- The agent may still request deeper paging on demand, but the default is a compiled, bounded, reproducible, testable working set.

ENGRAM-style results show this kind of budgeted assembly hits full-context-level quality at ~1% of the tokens - the efficiency that makes an unbounded life fit a fixed window.

---

## 7. Forgetting - decay + bi-temporal supersede, never deletion

Auditability is sacred, so nothing is hard-deleted.

- **Ranking decay:** low-activation memories fall out of the compiled context (§4) but remain queryable.
- **Bi-temporal supersede:** "I moved Delhi -> Bangalore" does not edit the old fact - it sets `t_invalid` on the old `memory_edge` and adds a new one, with a `superseded_by_event_id`.
  Retrieval never returns `t_invalid < now` facts as current truth, but a point-in-time query can still ask "what was true in March?".
  This is the mechanism that fixes temporal reasoning - the field's hardest axis (even GPT-4o-class systems score ~49% on it with decay alone).
- **Tiered storage:** cold, low-activation events/blobs migrate to the user's [storage backend](./STORAGE-BACKENDS.md) (warm index stays in the derived DB); promote-on-access.

---

## 8. Procedural memory - self-updating behavioral rules

**Novel for Life OS:** beyond facts, store **how to behave** - "when the user asks about a trade, always include the current market regime", "summaries should lead with the TLDR".
These are a separate procedural store that feeds the system prompt directly and is updated by consolidation, giving policy-learning-without-RL (LangMem's most distinctive idea).
The interface is kept clean (inputs: candidate events; outputs: rule deltas) so the policy can later be replaced by a learned one (Memory-R1) with no architectural change.

---

## 9. Multi-tier, multi-agent, isolated

- **One shared memory across tiers:** the Telegram bot (Haiku), the Mac harness, and the in-app agent all recall from the same canonical DB + derived indices (reusing `~/.claude/bin/memvec.py` and `memory-recall`).
  The shared DB *is* the cross-tier memory.
- **Write-heavy, read-cheap:** importance/entity extraction happen at write time (and in consolidation); the hot retrieval path makes **no LLM call** beyond optional query reformulation.
  This fits a personal OS where reads happen every turn and writes are comparatively rare.
- **Workspace-scoped:** every memory row carries `workspace_id`; a second workspace cannot recall the first's memories (RLS-style, [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) §5).
- **Secrets excluded; writes are events:** secrets never enter memory; agent memory-writes are `events` and therefore appear in the AGENT-CONTROL action ledger and are undoable.
  The agent may read/write memory but cannot touch the protected domains (VCS-rewrite, security config, OAuth/connections, API keys).

---

## 10. Reuse vs net-new

- **Reuse (already specified/built):** `events` (episodic spine), `entities`/`edges` (temporal graph), derived `entities_fts` + `entity_vec`, RRF via `~/.claude/bin/memory-recall`, `memvec.py` (MiniLM-384), the un-synced derived DB, the jobs/drain loop, the storage backends.
- **Net-new (the real work):** the event-sourced projection + replay cache (§2), the `memory_nodes`/`memory_edges`/`memory_summaries` read models with bi-temporal validity (§3), the activation re-ranker + reformulation + abstention (§4), the consolidation jobs with provenance/confidence (§5), the hybrid-deterministic context compiler (§6), supersede + tiering (§7), and the procedural store (§8).
- **Stack:** all of it sits on libSQL/Turso + sqlite-vec + FTS5 + Tokio (+ `petgraph` for spreading activation, `blake3` for the replay cache) - **zero new infrastructure** beyond what the system already plans, fully offline-capable.

---

## 11. Build surface & verification

- **Backend:** the projections + activation re-ranker + context compiler live in `lifeos-api`/`lifeos-pipelines`; consolidation runs as `jobs` drained by `lifeos-drain`.
- **Frontend:** a memory inspector (what the agent recalled and why - score breakdown), surfaced via the AGENT-CONTROL ledger.
- **Benchmark targets (regression-test against public sets):** LongMemEval (temporal reasoning + knowledge-updates + abstention), BEAM at 1M/10M (watch the scaling cliff), LoCoMo (multi-hop).
- **Must-pass checks:**
  - Delete the entire derived store + memory read models, recompute from `events`, and retrieval returns identical results (projection is truly derived).
  - A superseded fact ("moved cities") is never returned as current, but a point-in-time query still recovers the old value.
  - Every recalled fact resolves to its `source_event_ids`; nothing is recalled without provenance.
  - A turn needing no memory triggers the self-RAG gate (no retrieval); a genuinely-unknown fact triggers abstention, not confabulation.
  - No secret ever appears in a memory row; a second workspace recalls nothing of the first's.

---

**TLDR (layman engineer terms):** Build a small brain, not a vector DB.
Keep the append-only event log as the one source of truth and treat every summary/embedding/profile as a **rebuildable cache** of it (event-sourcing) - that buys provenance, safe forgetting, and trivial sync.
Recall by **relevance + recency + importance + how-often-used + a couple of graph hops** (not flat top-k), run nightly **"sleep" jobs** that distill raw events into compact facts (keeping pointers back to the originals so nothing important is silently lost), and assemble each turn's context with a **deterministic, token-budgeted compiler**.
Forgetting = ranking decay + marking old facts "no longer true" (never deletion) + moving cold data to the user's storage.
Most of the substrate already exists; the new parts are the projection/replay layer, the activation re-ranker, the consolidation jobs, and the context compiler - all on the libSQL + sqlite-vec + FTS5 stack you already planned.
