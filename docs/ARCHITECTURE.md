# Life OS - Architecture (master document)

This is the canonical, detailed architecture reference for Life OS.
`README.md` is the narrative superset; `CLAUDE.md` is the short working-rules companion; this `docs/` tree is the deep specification.
Read this file first, then the focused sub-documents it links.

> Status: design-complete specification, pre-implementation.
> Every claim here has been validated against how the underlying tools (Turso/libSQL, Claude Agent SDK, Nango, Cloudflare Workers, sqlite-vec) actually behave as of mid-2026; corrections to the original plan are called out inline and in the relevant sub-doc.

## 1. What Life OS is

A **self-extending, agent-driven personal operating system** that unifies learning, tasks, coding/projects, trading, social, marketing, design - and anything added later (email, calendar, files, reading, travel, health, finance, …) - behind:

1. **One generic multi-tenant entity-graph database** (no per-domain tables).
2. **A declarative module/plugin system** - new domains are manifests, not schemas.
3. **A self-extension builder** - an in-app AI that writes its own new modules on request.
4. **A universal version-control engine** (`lifeos-vcs`) that versions _every_ file type (video, image, design, 3D, audio, docs) git-style, not just code.
5. **An owned-credential integration layer** (Nango + a browser actuator) that connects any service - API or not - under credentials you control.
6. **The local Claude Code harness as the heavy brain**, plus an always-on Telegram/Cloudflare lane as the light brain.

It is personal today, **architected to become a multi-tenant SaaS with no rewrite**.

### The unifying frame: "GitHub for your whole life"

GitHub is a versioned object store + a collaboration/issue layer + an automation engine (Actions).
Life OS already has the substrate for all three: `entities` (the tree), `edges` (links), `events` (append-only history = the commit log), `jobs` (the runners).
So Life OS does not bolt on a second system; it **turns the schema you already have into a universal VCS + Actions platform that operates on any file type and any domain.**

---

## 2. Design principles (global invariants - do not violate)

1. **One generic schema, specialized by declarative manifests.** Storage is generic; per-domain behavior is metadata. The opposite of Notion's per-database modeling tax. A task / trade / topic / post / campaign / asset / email / trip are all rows in `entities`.
2. **Multi-tenant from the first commit.** Every data row carries `workspace_id`. Personal use is one workspace. No single-user assumptions, no hardcoded ids.
3. **Local-first, no lock-in.** SQLite-compatible store (libSQL); offline on the Mac via embedded replica; data is yours and portable.
4. **Codegen only on the trusted Mac.** The always-on cloud surface can only _enqueue_; all file-writing and reasoning-heavy work happens locally, behind validators, as revertable git commits.
5. **Auditability over speed; gate the irreversible.** Append-only `events`; outward/irreversible actions (social posts, trades, sends, browser actions) are human-gated; every self-built module is one `git revert` away.
6. **Owned credentials only.** No integration depends on a third party's account (notably: **not** the claude.ai MCP connectors). All OAuth flows use developer apps you own, tokens encrypted at rest, injected at call time, never in agent context. See [INTEGRATIONS.md](./INTEGRATIONS.md).
7. **Minimum always-on context, token-disciplined.** API-first thin tools over heavy MCPs; on-demand loading only; bounded context injection.
8. **Reuse before build; fork when 80% fits.** Generalize the existing `knowledge-atlas` app and harness infra; adopt battle-tested OSS (Nango, grammY, Drizzle, Refine, Claude Agent SDK, whisper-rs, jj); fork an OSS repo and extend it rather than writing net-new.
9. **Rust where it is security- or throughput-critical.** The local API, the VCS, the ingest pipeline, the broker guard, the job drainer, the pipeline engine - all Rust. The browser SPA, the Worker bot, the module manifests, the scaffolder stay JS/TS; memvec stays Python. See [RUST-COMPONENTS.md](./RUST-COMPONENTS.md).

### 3.1 Light/medium brain (cloud, always-on)

A Telegram bot on Cloudflare Workers (scale-to-zero compute = free) built with **grammY**, running on **Claude Haiku**.
It has **full common-DB access scoped to its workspace** (entities/edges/events/annotations RW), **harness memory recall** (shared-DB FTS5/vector), and **audit logging** (`events`).
It handles capture, queries, and medium actions, **gates outward actions** for approval, and **enqueues** anything heavy/codegen for the Mac.
It uses `@libsql/client/web` (HTTP transport - Workers have no filesystem or raw sockets).
It **holds no provider tokens**: outward provider calls are deferred to the Mac/Nango after approval; the Worker's only integration duty is hosting OAuth callbacks (or Nango hosts them).
Works with the laptop off. Compute is free; Haiku tokens are minimal.

**Implemented (issue #63):** `worker/` is the Cloudflare Worker project - `src/bot.ts`
defines the grammY `Bot` (currently just `/start` and `/health`, tested offline via
grammY's documented `botInfo` + `api.config.use` interception pattern, no network needed in
CI), `src/index.ts` is the Worker `fetch` handler routing `POST /telegram` through
`webhookCallback(bot, "cloudflare-mod")` and `GET /` as a bare liveness check. No DB access,
capture/query commands, or approve/deny keyboards yet - those are #64-67. Deploying for
real (Cloudflare account + a live Telegram bot token from @BotFather) is a manual step; see
`docs/MANUAL-SETUP.md` #63.

**Implemented (issue #64):** `worker/src/db.ts` binds `@lifeos/db/client/worker`
(`@libsql/client/web`, HTTP-only transport) and resolves the acting workspace from
`env.WORKSPACE_ID`, falling back to the same `"default-personal-workspace"` id
`services/lifeos-api/src/config.rs::DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` uses - never from Telegram input, so
the bot can't be tricked into reading/writing another tenant's rows. `src/entities.ts` is
the workspace-scoped repository (`listEntities`/`createEntity`, every query
`WHERE workspace_id = ?`); `src/llm.ts` wraps `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for Haiku calls. Both are
tested against a real in-memory libSQL DB (`@lifeos/db/client/local`, sharing this
package's own `drizzle-orm` instance via `@lifeos/db/query` - two independently-installed
copies of `drizzle-orm` produce structurally incompatible branded types, so every
`@lifeos/db` consumer must import query builders from `@lifeos/db/query`, not
`"drizzle-orm"` directly) and a stubbed `fetch` respectively - `worker/test/entities.test.ts`
asserts cross-workspace isolation directly. Not yet wired into a bot command (no live
network call happens on a real Telegram message) - that lands in #65 alongside capture/query
commands; the real `TURSO_URL`/`TURSO_TOKEN`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secrets are a manual step,
`docs/MANUAL-SETUP.md` #64.

### 3.2 Heavy brain (Mac)

The existing Claude Code harness does deep work: study authoring, coding, trade analysis, the self-extension builder, integration-heavy design/marketing work, media ingestion, agent pipelines, and the Eval/Release loop.
It runs the Rust services (`lifeos` API, `lifeos-vcs`, `lifeos-ingest`), self-hosted Nango, and the browser actuator.
It owns the single DB write token and the embedded replica (`offline:true` for local-first writes).

### 3.3 Canonical DB (Turso/libSQL)

SQLite wire-compatible (all existing FTS5 / `memvec.py` code ports unchanged), hosted and always reachable, purpose-built for multi-tenant SaaS (cheap database-per-tenant when we scale).
The engine itself is **written in Rust**.
An **embedded replica** on the Mac preserves local-first/offline; the cloud copy is always awake for Telegram.
See [DATA-MODEL.md](./DATA-MODEL.md) for the corrected sync semantics (last-push-wins, `offline:true`, derived-state-in-a-separate-DB).

### Key invariant

Request/state is **data** in the synced DB (survives the Mac being off); **codegen + heavy reasoning only ever run on the trusted Mac**; the cloud surface stays trivial and token-free.

## 5. Global data flow (one request, end to end)

**Capture from phone, laptop off:**
Telegram message → Worker (grammY) → Haiku interprets → writes `entity`/`event` to Turso (scoped to workspace) → replies.
If heavy ("ingest this video", "add a module") → writes a `jobs` row → replies "queued".

**Implemented (issue #67):** `worker/src/commands.ts` - `/addmodule <prompt>` writes a
`module_requests` row (`status='queued'`, `worker/src/moduleRequests.ts`), matching the
dedicated table this repo already uses for the self-extension queue (`db/schema.ts`'s
`moduleRequests`, mirrored from `migrations/0001_core.sql`), and `/ingest <text>` writes a
generic `jobs(kind='ingest')` row (`worker/src/jobs.ts::enqueueJob`, the same helper #66's
`execute_approval` jobs use). Both reply "queued" immediately and touch no filesystem -
there isn't one on a Cloudflare Worker, so "the bot never writes code/files" holds
structurally, not just by convention. Real dispatch (`lifeos-drain` claiming and running
these) is not built yet - its `dispatch()` doesn't recognize `ingest` or drain
`module_requests` at all, same gap #66 left for `execute_approval`.

**Heavy drain on the Mac:**
`launchd` poller (or on-wake) → `lifeos-drain` (Rust) atomically claims a `jobs` row (`UPDATE … RETURNING`) → runs the relevant Rust service or a headless Claude Agent SDK job → writes results + `events` → bot notifies.

**Outward action (gated):**
Agent produces a _draft_ (`gated` tool) → Telegram approve/deny buttons → on approve, the Mac/Worker calls the provider via the **Nango proxy** (token injected server-side; agent never saw it) or the **browser actuator** → `events` records the outward action.

**Search/recall:**
Any tier queries the FTS5 + sqlite-vec hybrid (RRF) over `lifeos-derived.db`; the shared canonical DB is the cross-tier memory.
